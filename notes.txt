React Notes:
- Image was affecting the size of the nav and footer bar.
	- Solution: adjust the body container to 100% width and height and set object-fit to cover.
		- Object fit ensures that the container is filled and crops when needed. Basically just scales the image to the size of the 	container
		- Applying 100% to width and Height makes the image fit to the size of its parent container

* Min-height allows for the lowest height the container could be. Reason: when i used regular height, the navbar was shrinking in height when the size viewing perspective changed

- Did not know how to have a button scroll to the contact form at the bottom of the page,
	- utilizing the onclick function allows for us to scroll to the bottom from a click
		- Uses two parameters top which determines how far from the top you want to go down
		- behavior, the type of animation you want after initiating the click

- What is useState({...})?
	- useState returns us an array with two elements of states
		- One element is for the current value of the state
		- Other element gives us the updated value of the state
		- Pass in an initial state into the function. In our case
		  the state are 3 different values set to null which are name, email
	- when we initialize a use state we need to destructure the return by setting the variable to array of size 2

- Why do we need ...prev in the arrow function?
	- We need the ... because it allows us to preserve the past information. It takes the prev state and copies it to ...prev

- What is the e in the arrow function?
	- It represents the DOM (Document Object Model) Event. These are events triggerd by user interactions 

- What is process.env?
	- It is an object that stores all environment variables for the current process
	- The env in this case is the link to the database

- vh is the full viewport height. So when you set height to 100vh it provides the full viewport height of whatever screen you are on.
  making it dynamic. Since my viewport height included the navbar, i had to use a calc function to subtract the 60px from the navbar to 
  the 100vh

- when overlapping text onto an image, the best approach is to use the background image css property because it allows the image to be more
  responsive in comparison to having an image and a div with text that is absolute because it will scale better on any platform.

- Wasn't sure if using flex box just for a button was necessary, but it is necessary when you need it for positioning. And in this case i 
  need it to be centered

- Problem: Text was not looking proper on the iamge because of the lighting.
	- Solution: Add a shadow to the text using the textShadow CSS property.
		- The first 3 attributes control the strength (3rd) and direction (1st and 2nd) of the shadow and the 4th controls the color of the shadow

- When wanting to scroll to specific part of the page, you need to give the section an id and then you need to wrap the button in a hashlink and you Pass
  in the id into the "smooth to" parameter
