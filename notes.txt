React Notes:
- Image was affecting the size of the nav and footer bar.
	- Solution: adjust the body container to 100% width and height and set object-fit to cover.
		- Object fit ensures that the container is filled and crops when needed. Basically just scales the image to the size of the 	container
		- Applying 100% to width and Height makes the image fit to the size of its parent container

* Min-height allows for the lowest height the container could be. Reason: when i used regular height, the navbar was shrinking in height when the size viewing perspective changed

- Did not know how to have a button scroll to the contact form at the bottom of the page,
	- utilizing the onclick function allows for us to scroll to the bottom from a click
		- Uses two parameters top which determines how far from the top you want to go down
		- behavior, the type of animation you want after initiating the click

- What is useState({...})?
	- useState returns us an array with two elements of states
		- One element is for the current value of the state
		- Other element gives us the updated value of the state
		- Pass in an initial state into the function. In our case
		  the state are 3 different values set to null which are name, email
	- when we initialize a use state we need to destructure the return by setting the variable to array of size 2

- Why do we need ...prev in the arrow function?
	- We need the ... because it allows us to preserve the past information. It takes the prev state and copies it to ...prev

- What is the e in the arrow function?
	- It represents the DOM (Document Object Model) Event. These are events triggerd by user interactions
